# Deno Nature School (Deno/Fresh Example)

This is a sample application for [Deno](https://www.deno.land) and
[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/), forked from
[Deno SaaSKit](https://deno.com/saaskit). We use [Deno KV](https://deno.com/kv)
as out primary data store, and are using Auth0 and Stripe to manage
authentication and payments, respectively.

Most weeks, this sample app is iterated on in real time during a live code
session scheduled on the [Deno community Discord](https://discord.gg/deno). If
you'd like to hang out and build this application collaboratively with us,
please stop by!

## About the example app

The concept for this example app is a website to manage a preschool for Denos
(the adorable dinosaur mascots of Deno). The site will have several public
marketing pages, and an authenticated admin panel where parents can sign their
Denos up for classes, and where staff members can configure admin-only
functions.
